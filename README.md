# UberAnalysis

Uber Analysis using Python:
This project involves analyzing Uber trip data using Python programming language. The aim of this project is to gain insights into Uber's business, such as popular pickup and drop-off locations, peak hours, and ride durations.

Data:
The data used in this project is a sample of Uber trip data, which contains information about the date and time of each trip, pickup and drop-off locations, and other trip-related metrics. 

Tools:
This project uses Python and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to read, manipulate, and visualize the data.

Analysis:
The data is analyzed using various techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The EDA involves creating various charts, such as scatter plots, histograms, and heat maps, to gain insights into the data.

Results:
The analysis reveals various insights about Uber's business, such as popular pickup and drop-off locations, peak hours, and ride durations. These insights can be used to make data-driven decisions and optimize Uber's operations.

Requirements:
Python 3.6 or later
Pandas library
NumPy library
Matplotlib library

Usage:
To run the code, first install the required dependencies. Then, download the Uber trip data and save it in the data directory. Finally, run the provided Jupyter notebook to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
